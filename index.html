      <strong>Notes for Grader:</strong><br><br>

      • <strong>Mouse Controls:</strong> Click and drag horizontally to rotate the camera left/right. Vertical dragging allows the user to look up/down. The original Q and E keys still work for rotation as well.<br><br>
    
      • <strong>Textures:</strong> I used multiple textures. <code>block.jpg</code> is applied to the cubes, and <code>sky.jpg</code> is applied to the sky.<br><br>
    
      • <strong>Performance:</strong> Due to the large 32×32 map with varying cube heights, my performance is very very slow. I apologize in advance, the canvas may take a few seconds to appear after the page loads and my webpage frequently crashes.<br><br>
    
      • <strong>Movement:</strong> The WASD keys allow basic movement. However, pressing the movement keys too quickly in succession may cause the webpage to crash, so just another heads up.<br><br>
    
      • <strong>Mouse Warning:</strong> Mouse drag rotation works, but, similarly, fast or repeated dragging may also cause the webpage to freeze or crash.<br><br>
    
      This assignment is not my best work, I have had some things going on in my personal life outside school and I've been trying to keep up with my workload on top of that.
